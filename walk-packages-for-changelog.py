# This is a program to generate an exhaustive set of changes in a ROS source
# tree.  This works by crawling the given source tree, building up a database
# of packages.  It also looks at an input ros2.repos file, and builds another
# database of repository names to version numbers.  For each of the packages,
# it looks at all of the changes to the CHANGELOG.rst file for that package
# since the earlier ros2.repos file, and collates all of them together into
# a single set of changes.  All of the collated changelog information is written
# to the given output_file.  If a repository doesn't have a CHANGELOG.rst file,
# this fact is noted and then printed to stdout at the end.

# This is a very complicated function to apply a set of transformations to a line.
# It ended up this complicated because I could not convince Python regular
# expressions to do all of these transformations in a non-greedy manner, but I'd
# be happy to trade all this complexity in for a smaller set of regular expressions
# that work.
#
# What this function is doing is applying the following RST rules to each line:
# 1. If a string contains ``foo``, that is a correctly emphasized word and we
#    leave it alone.
# 2. If a string contains `foo`, that is an incorrectly emphasized word and we
#    need to double up the `.
# 3. If a string contains `foo <>`_, that is hyperlink that is "non-anonymous".
#    That is, the word "foo" is now an anchor that can be referenced elsewhere.
#    However, since this is all auto-generated changelogs and we don't control
#    the input, we can definitely have collisions.  So we replace the single
#    underscore with a double-underscore, which makes it anonymous.
# 4. If a string contains `foo <>`__, it is already anonymous so we leave it alone.
# 5. Everything else we need to leave alone.
